### ‚öôÔ∏è Notes on Hosting

- SQLAlchemy abstracts database access, allowing flexibility in backend choice (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)  
- Hosting decisions are deferred; the bot is designed to be portable and environment-agnostic  
- Web app can be deployed alongside the bot or independently for remote control
